=====================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bertramdev/asset-pipeline.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertramdev/asset-pipeline)

Overview
--------
The Grails Asset-Pipeline is a plugin used for managing and processing static assets in [Grails](http://grails.org) applications. Asset-Pipeline functions include processing and minification of both CSS and JavaScript files. It is also capable of being extended to compile custom static assets, such as CoffeeScript or LESS.
